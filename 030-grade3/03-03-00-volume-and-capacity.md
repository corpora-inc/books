## Volume and Capacity

Understanding volume and capacity is essential in daily life, from cooking to filling a pool. Volume refers to the amount of space occupied by an object or substance, while capacity is the maximum amount that a container can hold. In this subsection, students will explore these concepts using both the metric and customary systems.

### Key Concepts

- **Volume**: The amount of three-dimensional space an object occupies. It's typically measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters ($cm^3$) or cubic meters ($m^3$).
- **Capacity**: The volume of substance (like liquid) that a container can hold. Common units include liters (L) for the metric system and gallons for the customary system.
- **Measurement Tools**: Recognizing tools such as measuring cups, graduated cylinders, and beakers to measure liquid capacities accurately.

### Real-World Applications

- **Cooking and Baking**: Accurate measurements of volume and capacity are crucial for recipes.
- **Construction**: Knowing the volume is essential in tasks like cement mixing or pool filling.
- **Everyday Tasks**: Filling a gasoline tank, watering plants, or even choosing the right size of a beverage container.

### Practice Problems

1. If a measuring cup can hold up to 250 milliliters, how many such cups are needed to fill a liter jug?
2. Calculate the volume of a box with dimensions 4 cm by 5 cm by 6 cm.
3. Which container has a greater capacity: one that holds 2 liters or another that holds 1.5 gallons? (Note: 1 gallon $\approx$
 3.785 liters)
4. How many 250 ml bottles can be filled from a 5-liter water tank?
5. A swimming pool is being filled with water at a rate of 500 liters per hour. How long will it take to fill the pool if its capacity is 3000 liters?
