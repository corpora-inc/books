# Return the same file with the following changes:
# 1. Add detailed explanations of concepts and methods.
# 2. Clean up vertical white space:
#    Be generous with vertical space following conventional markdown linting guidelines.
#    Separate markdown features with a single blank line. Do not use more than one blank line.
# 3. Give intuition about the concepts to help the reader understand and remember.
# 4. Make figure descriptions (image alt text) *more concise and clear* with proper inline math.
#    Inline LaTeX should be used, e.g. $f(x)=x^2$, in the descriptions.
#    DO NOT CHANGE THE PATHS TO THE IMAGES.
# 5. Ensure correct math formatting. Replace usage of \(
#    and \) with $ for inline math. Replace usage of \[
#    and \] with $$ for block math.

# Remove special characters such as `π`, `∛`, `⁻`, `∘`, and `≤` and replace with proper LaTeX math formatting.

# The focus is on teaching the College Algebra material in a way that is engaging and easy to understand.

# Remove anything that does not contribute to the student's mastery of Algebra for the College Algebra CLEP exam.

# Expand on anything that is not clear or could be better explained. Explain fully!

# If a section is already clear and well explained, do not change it.
# If a section is confusing or makes no sense, you can rewrite it completely.

# Proofread and return the file to be part of the greatest College Algebra course ever.

# If the file is already perfect, return it unchanged.

# Make sure everything is correct and fill out with more verbose explanations for each step and maybe some intuition so a newb can learn how to do this and can follow easily each step.

# Be verbose and explain everything in detail.

# DO NOT USE `\begin{array}` or other macros that don't work with epub.

Don't mention over and over things like:

"Understanding these ideas builds a strong foundation that will help you tackle more complex topics in college-level mathematics and real-world applications. By mastering these fundamentals, you develop a systematic approach to problem-solving, making it easier to analyze and solve challenges in areas like economics, engineering design, and sports statistics."

Instead, focus on the math and the concepts. Focus on fitting more math and concise examples and explanations and definitions into the same space.

Don't _tell_ the reader what this is good for. Show with examples. Don't add generic AI-filler fluff. Remove it.

Use creative and thought-provoking examples that are different that others in the context. Make more imaginative examples that are unlikely to be repeated in the book.

Less AI blather, more math. More examples. Concise drills.

Don't tell the reader about finance, science, engineering and data analytics - show with examples.

Fast, hard-hitting, concise examples.

Some examples will need to be stated very slowly with simple steps. But, some you can show several in a compact way, especially after you have established the pattern.
