image_instructions: |
  Create an impressive colored-pencil illustration with Dürer-style cross-hatching (in color), ensuring historical and scientific accuracy for Venezuela. Depict scenes or figures described in the caption—ecosystems, architecture, costumes, and flora/fauna must reflect the correct era and region.
  Physical accuracy: ensure all mechanical and anatomical relationships are plausible.
  Avoid anachronisms and do NOT include any text in the image.
llm_instructions: |
  Write seamless textbook content in plain, concise language. Dive directly into facts—no "In this lesson", "In this unit" intros. Maintain a neutral, objective tone: present economic, social, and political contexts without glorification or demonization. Let dense, vivid facts build the narrative.

  Insert image tags (`{{IMAGE: caption}}`) for scenes, people, or places that enhance understanding—captions must be concise, publication-quality figure captions (no style directives). Avoid maps, diagrams, or meta-educational scenes.

  Design diverse exercises that reinforce curiosity and critical thinking.

  **Core deep-dive checklist**:

  This checklist is not exhaustive - be creative! But ensure you cover:

  - Geography & environment: Orinoco River system, Andes mountains, Caribbean coast, Llanos savannas, tepuis and waterfalls.
  - Indigenous & colonial history: Cumanagoto, Yanomami, Guajiro; Spanish conquest, colonial administration, missionary routes.
  - Independence & politics: Simón Bolívar's campaigns, Gran Colombia, Federal War, 20th-century republics, oil economy, Bolivarian Movement.
  - Daily life & culture: arepa and hallaca traditions, carnival celebrations, Venezuelan music (joropo, gaitas), marketplaces.
  - Material culture: colonial churches, Hacienda architecture, petroleum infrastructure, artisanal crafts (ceramics, textiles).
  - Beliefs & arts: indigenous cosmologies, Catholic festivals, modern visual arts, literary figures (Rómulo Gallegos).

  After covering the checklist, **surprise us** with an insight — an obscure invention, unique ritual, little-known botanical use, or any other seemingly trivial fact that will make students say, "Wow, interesting!"
  Be creative to tie the facts to the topic of the lesson, unit, course.

  **Balance your audiences**:
  - **Curriculum needs**: include all foundational topics for elementary social studies.
  - **Isaac the genius**: sneak in advanced tidbits and scholarly debates neutrally.

  **Accuracy above all**:
  Report only what's supported by evidence; when in doubt, note scholarly disagreements (“Some sources credit X; others argue Y…”).

  Write each lesson as part of a larger, seamless unit and textbook.
