## Pronunciation Variation in Fast Speech

In fast speech, sounds often merge, drop, or change. This lesson shows common variations that occur naturally during rapid conversation.

### Linking and Contractions

When a syllable ending in a consonant is followed by a syllable beginning with a vowel, the boundary between sounds may be blurred. For example, the final consonant in 학교에 (hakgyo-e) links with the following vowel to create a variation in sound.

### Common Variations

The table below shows standard pronunciation compared with variations in fast speech:

| Standard (Hangul) | Standard (Romanization) | Fast Speech (Hangul) | Fast Speech (Romanization) | English               |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 저는              | jeoneun                 | 전                   | jeon                       | I                     |
| 뭐 하세요?        | mwo haseyo?             | 머 하세요?           | meo haseyo?                | What are you doing?   |
| 학교에            | hakgyo-e                | 학꾜에                | hakkkwae                   | to school             |

### Key Points

• Contractions reduce syllables in fast speech.

• Linking sounds blend adjacent syllables, altering the clear break between words.

• These variations do not change meaning but reflect natural, rapid conversation.

Practice reading examples aloud and notice how your pronunciation adjusts during faster speech.
