## Building Sentences with "And" Particles

This lesson explains how to connect words and clauses using "and" particles in Korean.

### 1. Using 와/과 to Connect Nouns

For connecting nouns, use 와 or 과 after a noun. 
• Use 와 after nouns ending in a vowel.
• Use 과 after nouns ending in a consonant.

Examples:

• 사과와 배
  *sagwa wa bae* — apple and pear

• 책과 연필
  *chaek gwa yeonpil* — book and pencil

#### Vocabulary

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | English |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| 사과            | sagwa        | apple   |
| 배              | bae          | pear    |
| 책              | chaek        | book    |
| 연필            | yeonpil      | pencil  |

### 2. Using 고 to Connect Actions

When joining clauses or verbs, attach 고 to the verb stem of the first action. It means "and" or "then."

Examples:

• 저는 밥을 먹고 커피를 마셔요.
  *jeoneun babeul meokgo keopi reul masyeoyo* — I eat and drink coffee.

• 저는 공부하고 운동해요.
  *jeoneun gongbuhago undonghaeyo* — I study and exercise.

Note: 고 links sequential actions. Actions linked by 고 usually follow the order in which events occur.

Practice building your own sentences by connecting actions and items using 와/과 and 고.
