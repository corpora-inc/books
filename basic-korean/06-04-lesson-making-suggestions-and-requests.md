## Making Suggestions and Requests

In Korean, suggestions and requests are expressed with specific verb endings. Use casual forms with ~자 and polite forms with ~할까요? for suggestions. Use 주세요 or 해 주세요 for requests.

### Making Suggestions

#### Casual Suggestions (~자)

For casual conversations between friends or peers, attach ~자 to the verb stem.

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | English          |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| 먹자            | meokja       | Let's eat        |
| 가자            | gaja         | Let's go         |
| 보자            | boja         | Let's see        |

#### Polite Suggestions (~할까요?)

For polite suggestions, attach ~할까요? to the verb stem. This form is used in questions that propose an action.

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization    | English              |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 먹을까요?       | meogeulkkayo?   | Shall we eat?        |
| 갈까요?         | galkkayo?       | Shall we go?         |
| 볼까요?         | bolkkayo?       | Shall we see?        |

### Making Requests

For requests, Korean uses endings such as 주세요 and 해 주세요. These forms are attached to the verb or noun to politely ask for something.

| Korean (Hangul)   | Romanization       | English                     |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| 주세요            | juseyo             | Please give it to me        |
| 물 좀 주세요       | mul jom juseyo     | Please give me some water   |
| 도와주세요        | dowachuseyo        | Please help me              |
| 해 주세요         | hae juseyo         | Please do it                |

Practice these structures by replacing the verb stem with other actions to make your own suggestions and requests.
