## Pronunciation Shortcuts and Phonetic Rules

Fluent Korean often uses pronunciation shortcuts that streamline speech. The following phonetic rules illustrate common adjustments made during natural conversation.

### 1. Liaison Rule (연음법칙)
When a syllable ending in a consonant is followed by a syllable starting with a vowel, the final consonant may shift to the beginning of the next syllable.

For example:

| Hangul         | Romanization    | Pronunciation Shortcut |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 밥 먹어요      | bap meok-eoyo   | bam meok-eoyo          |

In this example, the final consonant ㅂ in 밥 links to the following vowel sound in 먹어요, changing its articulation to an [m] sound.

### 2. Nasal Assimilation
Certain consonants become nasalized when they occur before a vowel-initial syllable that promotes nasal sound production. In the liaison example above, the ㅂ in 밥 is pronounced as ㅁ, resulting in bam.

These adjustments are part of natural speech flow, making words easier to pronounce during conversation.

### 3. Vowel Contraction
In rapid or casual speech, compound vowels often contract to form simpler sounds. A common example involves the verb 보다 combined with an additional vowel sound:

| Hangul | Romanization | Explanation                                 |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 봐요   | bwa-yo       | Contraction of 보아요 for smoother pronunciation |

This contraction helps maintain fluent rhythm in spoken Korean.
