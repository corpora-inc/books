Read each word aloud, focusing on the formation of Hangul syllable blocks.

Repeat the following practice sequence several times:

1. 학교 – *hakgyo* – school
2. 친구 – *chingu* – friend
3. 사과 – *sagwa* – apple
4. 물 – *mul* – water
5. 집 – *jip* – house

Practice by covering the romanization and English columns and reading each Hangul word until recognition is automatic.

### Sentence Practice

Practice simple sentences using vocabulary from the table to build fluency:

- 나는 학교에 가요.
  *na-neun hakgyo-e ga-yo* — I go to school.
