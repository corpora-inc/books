## Introduction to Descriptive Verbs

Descriptive verbs (commonly known as adjectives) express qualities or states of a noun. In Korean, many adjectives end in 다 in their dictionary form. When conjugated for polite speech, the ending 다 is replaced with 아요 or 어요 according to vowel harmony.

### Vocabulary

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | English            |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 예쁘다          | yeppeuda     | to be pretty       |
| 작다            | jakda        | to be small        |
| 크다            | keuda        | to be big          |
| 좋다            | jota         | to be good         |
| 맛있다          | masitda      | to be delicious    |

### Basic Structure

Nouns are marked with 은/는 when described by a descriptive verb. The typical sentence pattern is:

Noun + 은/는 + [descriptive verb in polite form]

### Examples

- 이 꽃은 예뻐요.
  *i kkoch-eun yeppeoyo* — This flower is pretty.

- 집은 커요.
  *jib-eun keoyo* — The house is big.

- 날씨는 좋아요.
  *nalssineun joayo* — The weather is good.

- 음식은 맛있어요.
  *eumsik-eun masisseoyo* — The food is delicious.

### Conjugation Note

To form the polite style, remove the 다 ending and add 아요 or 어요 based on the final vowel of the verb stem. For example:

- 예쁘다 → 예뻐요
- 작다 → 작아요
- 크다 → 커요
- 좋다 → 좋아요
- 맛있다 → 맛있어요

Repeat the examples to build fluency with these descriptive verbs.
