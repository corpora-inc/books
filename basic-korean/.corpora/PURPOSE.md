*Basic Korean* is a comprehensive beginnerâ€™s textbook designed to take English-speaking learners from zero knowledge to full literacy in Hangul, foundational grammar, and essential vocabulary. Though the title is modest, the goal is ambitious: to create a complete, structured, and immersive guide to the Korean language.

Each unit includes:
- one `intro` file with a clear overview,
- multiple `lesson` files filled with Hangul, romanization, and concise English explanations,
- and one `culture` file that offers deeper context and real-world connection.

Lessons focus on Hangul-first learning, with romanization and English used to support understanding. Cultural sections provide space for English-rich storytelling to inspire curiosity and human connection.
