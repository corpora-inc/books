Write in a concise, precise, and instructional tone suitable for a comprehensive language textbook. Each file is a small part of a larger book — not a standalone article or blog post. Do not include introductions, summaries, or conclusions unless explicitly part of the content.

- Do **not** preview what the lesson will cover or summarize what was learned.
- Do **not** restate the filename, lesson number, or explain the purpose of the file.
- Avoid commentary about the beauty or difficulty of Korean — focus on clear instruction.

For `lesson` files:
- Prioritize **Hangul**, with **romanization** and **English translation** used to support understanding.
- Structure content around **real examples** and **repetition** to build reading fluency.
- Explanations should be brief, functional, and neutral in tone.
- Use English only to clarify — not to commentate.

For `culture` files:
- A more relaxed narrative tone is acceptable.
- Write in English, using Korean terms where appropriate.
- Keep it informative, not opinionated or verbose.

Across all files:
- Follow `STRUCTURE.md` for consistent headers.
- Avoid filler, flourish, or conversational asides.
- This is a **book**, not a blog. Favor clarity over cleverness.
