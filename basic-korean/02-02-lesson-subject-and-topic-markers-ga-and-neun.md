## Subject and Topic Markers: 가 and 는

In Korean, particles are attached to nouns to indicate their role in the sentence. The subject marker (가) and the topic marker (는) help clarify which noun is the subject or the topic.

- Use 가 when introducing or emphasizing a subject (especially new information).
- Use 는 when setting the topic or contrasting known information.

### Subject Marker – 가

Attach 가 to a noun that is the subject of the sentence. Often, it highlights the entity performing the action or experiencing a state.

Examples:

1. 사과가 맛있어요.
   *sagwa-ga masisseoyo* — The apple is tasty.

2. 친구가 왔어요.
   *chingu-ga wasseoyo* — A friend came.

### Topic Marker – 는

Attach 는 to a noun to establish the topic of conversation. It frames the sentence based on what is already known or contrasted.

Examples:

1. 나는 학생이에요.
   *na-neun haksaeng-ieyo* — I am a student.

2. 이 책은 재미있어요.
   *i chaek-eun jaemiisseoyo* — This book is interesting.

### Comparison of Markers

| Function          | Marker | Example Sentence            | Romanization                | English Translation              |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Subject (new info)| 가     | 사과가 맛있어요.             | sagwa-ga masisseoyo         | The apple is tasty.              |
| Topic (known info)| 는     | 나는 학생이에요.             | na-neun haksaeng-ieyo        | I am a student.                  |

Notice that while both markers attach to the noun, the choice between 가 and 는 depends on whether you are presenting new information (subject) or discussing an ongoing topic (topic).

Practice by substituting different nouns and observing how the meaning shifts based on the particle used.
