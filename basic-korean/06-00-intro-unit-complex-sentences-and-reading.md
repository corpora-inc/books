# Unit 06: Complex Sentences and Reading

This unit introduces advanced sentence structures that connect ideas to form complex sentences. You will learn to combine clauses using connectors that indicate contrast, sequence, causality, and condition.

Topics include:
- Combining clauses with connectors such as -지만 (but), -고 (and), -서 (so/because), and -면서 (while).
- Forming conditional statements and expressing cause-and-effect relationships.
- Reading short narratives and dialogues that use complex sentence structures.
- Strategies for summarizing and clarifying information in context.

Example:
• 집은 작지만, 마음은 넓어요.
  *jibeun jagjiman, maeum-eun neolbeoyo* — The house is small, but the heart is big.
