## Final Consonants (받침, Batchim)

In Hangul, syllable blocks may end with a final consonant called 받침 (batchim). The 받침 plays a key role in distinguishing word meanings and affects pronunciation.

### Syllable Structure with Batchim

A syllable block is formed with an initial consonant, a vowel, and optionally a final consonant:

• 초성 (initial consonant)
• 중성 (vowel)
• 종성 (final consonant or 받침)

Example:

- 밥
  *bap* — meal

### Pronunciation Rules

1. The final consonant is pronounced at the end of a syllable. For example, in 밥 (*bap*), the sound [p] is pronounced clearly at the end.

2. When a syllable beginning with a vowel follows a syllable with 받침, pronunciation may change. For example, in 밥을 (*bapeul*), the 받침 [p] can carry over to the next syllable as a [p] or [b] sound depending on the following vowel.

### Practice with Batchim

Review these examples where 받침 is present:

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | English       |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 밥              | bap          | meal/rice     |
| 닭              | dak          | chicken       |
| 꽃              | kkot         | flower        |
| 잎              | ip           | leaf          |
| 알              | al           | egg           |

Practice reading these words aloud, paying attention to the final consonant sound.

### Additional Notes

- Some 받침 can have variable pronunciation depending on context. Focus on the basic sound for each final consonant until comfortable with more advanced assimilation rules.

Repeat each example to build fluency and accuracy in pronunciation.
