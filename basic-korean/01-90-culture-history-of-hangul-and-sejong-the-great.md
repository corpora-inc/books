## History of Hangul and Sejong the Great

Hangul, the native Korean alphabet, was created during the 15th century under the guidance of King Sejong the Great (세종대왕). King Sejong initiated this revolutionary project to promote literacy and empower all social classes with the ability to read and write. Prior to Hangul, Korean scholars relied on Classical Chinese, limiting accessibility to education for the common people.

Sejong and his scholars designed Hangul to be logically structured and easy to learn. Its scientific arrangement of consonants and vowels reflects the natural speech sounds of the Korean language. The system’s simplicity allowed it to spread quickly among the population, fostering a more inclusive society that valued knowledge and communication.

Today, Hangul is celebrated not only as a tool for daily communication but also as a symbol of Korean identity and cultural pride. The creation of Hangul is a lasting legacy of King Sejong’s vision, emphasizing that language can serve as a bridge to education, equality, and national unity.
