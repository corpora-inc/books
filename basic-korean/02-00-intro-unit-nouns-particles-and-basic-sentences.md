# Unit 02: Nouns, Particles, and Basic Sentences

This unit provides an introduction to essential nouns, basic particles, and simple sentence constructions in Korean. The focus is on recognizing common nouns, understanding how particles attach to these nouns to indicate grammatical roles, and forming basic sentences.

Key Focus Areas:

• Essential Nouns: Identify everyday nouns (e.g., 학생 – *haksaeng* – student, 학교 – *hakgyo* – school).

• Particles: Learn how particles such as 은/는 (*eun/neun*) for topics and 이/가 (*i/ga*) for subjects are used with nouns.

• Basic Sentence Structure: Practice arranging words in Korean sentences. For example:

- 저는 학생이에요.
  *jeoneun haksaeng-ieyo* — I am a student.

This unit lays the foundation for understanding how nouns and particles work together to create meaningful sentences in Korean.
