## Education, Family, and School in Korea

Korea places a strong emphasis on education, where academic success is often seen as a key to future opportunities. The schooling system is rigorous, and students typically spend many hours in class as well as in after-school academies (학원, *hagwon*). Education is considered a communal effort that involves families, schools, and society at large.

### Educational System

Schools in Korea are structured environments where discipline, respect, and hard work are integral. Students interact closely with teachers (선생님, *seonsaengnim*) and peers, cultivating a sense of community and shared responsibility. The competitive nature of exams and entrance tests influences both teaching methods and student life.

### Family Influence

Family (가족, *gajok*) plays a crucial role in a student's educational journey. Korean families traditionally support and sometimes pressure children to excel academically. This deep involvement reflects cultural values that stress respect, obedience, and duty to one’s family.
