## Negative Sentences with 안 and 못

Korean negation can be expressed using two forms: **안** and **못**. Both are placed before the main verb, but they serve different purposes.

- **안 (an)**: Indicates a simple negation, meaning "not." It expresses that an action is not performed.
- **못 (mot)**: Indicates inability or impossibility, meaning "cannot." It is used when someone is unable to perform an action due to circumstances or lack of ability.

### Using 안

Insert **안** before the verb to state that an action is not done.

Examples:

| Korean (Hangul)          | Romanization                   | English            |

### Using 못

Insert **못** before the verb to state inability or impossibility.
