## 01-08 Lesson: Hangul Handwriting and Typing

### Handwriting Hangul

Proper handwriting builds a strong foundation in reading and writing Hangul. Follow the stroke order for each letter to form clear, balanced characters.

Practice with basic jamo:

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | Stroke Order Notes                                              |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ㄱ              | giyeok       | Start with a horizontal line; finish with a short vertical stroke |
| ㄴ              | nieun        | Draw a vertical line; then add a horizontal line at the bottom      |
| ㅏ              | a            | Draw a vertical line; add a short horizontal line to the right      |

Practice combining jamo to form syllables. For example:

- 가: composed of ㄱ + ㅏ
  *ga* – basic syllable
- 나: composed of ㄴ + ㅏ
  *na* – basic syllable

Repeat these examples to develop muscle memory and familiarity with stroke order.

### Typing Hangul

Typing Hangul uses the standard 2-set (Dubeolsik) keyboard layout. Focus on mapping keys to jamo and combining them into syllables automatically.

Follow these steps when typing:

1. Enable the Korean input mode on your device.
2. Type the consonant for the initial sound, then the vowel. The system will form a syllable block automatically.
3. For syllables with final consonants (batchim), type the final consonant after the vowel.

Examples of syllable formation:

| Syllable | Composition         | Romanization | Explanation                           |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| 가       | ㄱ + ㅏ              | ga           | Initial ㄱ and vowel ㅏ combine        |
| 닭       | ㄷ + ㅏ + ㄺ         | dak          | Consonant ㄷ, vowel ㅏ, and final ㄺ      |

Practice by typing simple syllables:

- 가, 나, 다
- 마, 바, 사

Consistent practice in both handwriting and typing will reinforce your reading fluency and accuracy in writing Hangul.
