Restaurant staff typically greet diners with a polite welcome. For example, a waiter might say:

| Speaker | Korean (Hangul)           | Romanization             | English                   |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Waiter  | 어서 오세요!              | eoseo oseyo!             | Welcome!                  |
| Customer | 메뉴 좀 보여 주세요.       | menyu jom boyeo juseyo.   | Please show me the menu.  |

During meals, it is customary to use communal dishes and share food. This practice promotes conversation and a sense of community. Various regional dishes, seasonal ingredients, and presentation styles all contribute to the overall dining experience in Korea.
