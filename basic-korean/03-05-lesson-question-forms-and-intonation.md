## Lesson: Question Forms and Intonation

Korean questions use specific sentence endings and intonation to indicate inquiry. This lesson presents common question forms and the role of intonation in signaling questions.

### Basic Question Endings

Korean typically adds a rising ending to a statement to form a question. In formal settings, the ending “-습니까?” is used; in polite informal settings, “-어요?” is common. 

Examples:

- Statement: 학교에 갑니다.
  *hakgyoe gamnida* — (I go to school.)

- Formal Question: 학교에 갑니까?
  *hakgyoe gamnikka?* — Are you going to school?

- Informal Question: 학교에 가요?
  *hakgyoe gayo?* — Are you going to school?

### Informal Question Forms and Intonation

In casual conversations, speakers often form questions by using a statement form with a rising intonation. The same sentence can be interpreted as a question when spoken with a rising pitch.

Examples:

- Informal Statement: 먹어.
  *meogeo* — (You eat.)

- Informal Question (with rising intonation): 먹어?
  *meogeo?* — Are you eating?

Another common informal question uses the particle “니?”.

Example:

- Statement: 너 뭐해.
  *neo mwohae* — (You are doing something.)

- Informal Question: 너 뭐해니?
  *neo mwohaeni?* — What are you doing?

### Question Words and Rising Intonation

Question words such as 뭐 (what), 어디 (where), 왜 (why) inherently signal a question when paired with the correct intonation.

Vocabulary Table:

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | English  |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| 뭐              | mwo          | what     |
| 어디            | eodi         | where    |
| 왜              | wae          | why      |

Examples:

- 이것은 뭐예요?
  *igeoseun mwoyeyo?* — What is this?

- 어디에 가요?
  *eodie gayo?* — Where are you going?

- 왜 그래요?
  *wae geuraeyo?* — Why is that so?

### Dialogue Examples

The following dialogue illustrates the use of question forms and intonation in context.

| Speaker | Korean (Hangul)       | Romanization          | English                  |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| A       | 오늘 뭐 해요?         | oneul mwo haeyo?      | What are you doing today?|
| B       | 영화 보러 가요.       | yeonghwa boreo gayo.  | I’m going to watch a movie. |

| Speaker | Korean (Hangul)       | Romanization          | English                  |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| A       | 어디 가요?            | eodi gayo?            | Where are you going?     |
| B       | 집으로 가요.         | jibeuro gayo.         | I’m going home.          |

### Key Points on Intonation

- Rising pitch at the end of a sentence indicates a question in informal speech.
- In formal questions, the sentence ending (e.g., -습니까?) makes the inquiry clear without relying on intonation.
- Practice by reading sentences aloud and varying your pitch at the end to signal question forms.

Use these forms in practice exercises to build fluency with both structure and intonation.
