## Introduction to Hangul and Why It Matters

Hangul is the Korean writing system, composed of letters that form syllable blocks. It uses 자음 (consonants) and 모음 (vowels) arranged in a logical structure. Understanding these basic elements is essential for reading and writing Korean.

### Basic Structure of Hangul

In Hangul, individual letters combine to form a syllable. The typical block consists of an initial consonant and a vowel. For example:

- ㄱ + ㅏ = 가
  *Romanization: ga* – This syllable is formed by combining the consonant ㄱ (giyeok) and the vowel ㅏ (a).

Below is a table of key letters used in Hangul:

| Hangul | Romanization | Description              |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| ㄱ     | giyeok       | Consonant (g/k sound)    |
| ㄴ     | nieun        | Consonant (n sound)      |
| ㄷ     | digeut       | Consonant (d/t sound)    |
| ㅏ     | a            | Vowel (a sound)          |
| ㅓ     | eo           | Vowel (uh sound)         |

### Syllable Formation Examples

Combining letters in order creates syllable blocks. Consider the following examples:

| Syllable | Composition | Romanization |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 가       | ㄱ + ㅏ    | ga           |
| 나       | ㄴ + ㅏ    | na           |
| 다       | ㄷ + ㅏ    | da           |

Practice reading and writing these blocks. Mastery of Hangul provides a solid foundation for advancing in Korean language studies.
