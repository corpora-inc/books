### Syllable Formation Practice

Combine a basic consonant with a vowel to form a syllable. Practice reading simple blocks:

| Syllable (Hangul) | Components   | Romanization |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 가                | ㄱ + ㅏ      | ga           |
| 나                | ㄴ + ㅏ      | na           |
| 다                | ㄷ + ㅏ      | da           |

Practice by identifying the consonant and vowel in each syllable. Repeat the symbol names, their romanizations, and the associated sounds to build fluency.
