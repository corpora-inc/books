## Present Tense Politeness Levels

In Korean, verb endings change to express different levels of politeness. In the present tense, the same verb stem can take on various endings to indicate formality and social context. This lesson introduces three common levels:

1. Informal Low (반말)
2. Informal Polite (해요체)
3. Formal Polite (합니다체)

### Verb Conjugation Overview

For a given verb stem, the present tense endings are added as follows:

| Speech Level       | Ending       | Example with 하다 (to do) | Romanization    | English            |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Informal Low       | –해          | 해                       | hae             | do                 |
| Informal Polite    | –해요        | 해요                     | haeyo           | do [polite]        |
| Formal Polite      | –합니다      | 합니다                   | hamnida         | do [formal]        |

### Additional Example: 가다 (to go)

| Speech Level       | Ending       | Conjugated Form | Romanization    | English            |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Informal Low       | –가          | 가              | ga              | go                 |
| Informal Polite    | –가요        | 가요            | gayo            | go [polite]        |
| Formal Polite      | –갑니다      | 갑니다          | gamnida         | go [formal]        |

### Practice Exercises

### Usage Guidelines

- The Informal Polite form is standard for everyday conversations and with people of similar age or status.
- The Formal Polite form is appropriate for formal settings, public announcements, or when speaking with strangers in professional contexts.

Practice forming the correct endings with other verb stems to build confidence in selecting the appropriate politeness level.
