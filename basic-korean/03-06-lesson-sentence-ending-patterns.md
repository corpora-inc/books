## Sentence Ending Patterns

Sentence endings in Korean determine the tone, politeness level, and intention of a sentence. Endings attach to verb or adjective stems and signal whether the statement is a declaration, question, command, or suggestion.

### Usage Notes

- Choose the sentence ending based on the relationship between speakers and the context. 
- The informal polite endings (-아요/-어요) are common in everyday conversation among adults.
- Formal endings (-습니다/-ㅂ니다) are used in official, public, or unfamiliar settings.
- Changing the ending can subtly change the nuance of the sentence.

Practice transforming sentence stems by attaching different endings to see how meaning and tone adjust. Focus on accuracy in the Hangul, and use romanization and English translations as guides.
