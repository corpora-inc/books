## Basic Sentence Structure: SVO vs SOV

Korean sentences generally follow a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order, differing from the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order common in English.

In Korean, particles mark the subject and object, and the verb always comes at the end. This structure requires the listener to wait until the end of the sentence to know the action.

### Example 1

• Korean: 저는 사과를 먹어요.

• Romanization: jeoneun sagwareul meogeoyo

• English: I eat an apple.

### Example 2

• Korean: 친구가 영화를 봐요.

• Romanization: chinguga yeonghwareul bwayo

• English: The friend watches a movie.

### English vs. Korean Order

• English (SVO): I (subject) eat (verb) rice (object).

• Korean (SOV): 저는 (subject) 밥을 (object) 먹어요 (verb).

### Key Points

• Korean sentences end with the verb.

• Particles such as 는/가 (subject) and 을/를 (object) help identify sentence roles.

• Understanding the SOV structure is critical for forming correct and natural Korean sentences.
