## Syllable Structure Blocks

Hangul syllables are visual units composed of individual letters arranged into a square. Each syllable block is made up of the following components:

• Initial consonant (초성)
• Medial vowel (중성)
• Optional final consonant (종성), known as batchim

The placement of vowels influences the structure of the block. For vowels written to the right (e.g., ㅏ, ㅓ), the initial consonant is on the left. For vowels written below (e.g., ㅗ, ㅜ), the initial consonant sits on top.

Practice identifying each component in the syllable blocks.

### Example Breakdown

Examine the syllable block for 한:

• Initial (초성): ㅎ (h)
• Medial (중성): ㅏ (a)
• Final (종성): ㄴ (n)

The syllable 한 is romanized as *han*.

Another example is 글:

• Initial (초성): ㄱ (g)
• Medial (중성): ㅡ (eu)
• Final (종성): ㄹ (l)

The syllable 글 is romanized as *geul*.

### Syllable Structure Table

| Syllable | Initial (초성) | Medial (중성) | Final (종성) | Romanization |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 한       | ㅎ (h)         | ㅏ (a)       | ㄴ (n)      | han          |
| 글       | ㄱ (g)         | ㅡ (eu)       | ㄹ (l)      | geul         |

Focus on the order and placement of letters while reading and writing. Consistent practice in breaking down syllable blocks builds fluency in recognizing Hangul's structure.
