## Using -지만, -고 서, and -면서

This lesson introduces three conjunctions that connect clauses in Korean. They add contrast, sequence, or indicate simultaneous actions.

### 1. -지만

Use -지만 to express contrast between two clauses. It is attached to the end of a descriptive clause.

Example:

• 한국어는 어렵지만 재미있어요.
  
  *Hangugeoneun eoryeopjiman jaemiisseoyo*  — Korean is difficult, but it is interesting.

Additional example:

• 이 책은 길지만 유익해요.
  
  *I chaekeun giljiman yuikhaeyo*  — This book is long, but it is informative.

### 2. -고 서

Use -고 서 to show that one action is completed before the next begins. It connects sequential actions.

Example:

• 밥을 먹고 서, 산책을 했어요.
  
  *Babeul meokgo seo, sanchaekeul haesseoyo*  — After eating, I went for a walk.

Additional example:

• 문을 열고 서, 친구가 들어왔어요.
  
  *Muneul yeolgo seo, chinguga deureowasseoyo*  — After opening the door, my friend came in.

### 3. -면서

Use -면서 to indicate that two actions occur simultaneously or to provide background information while another action takes place.

Example:

• 음악을 들으면서 숙제를 해요.
  
  *Eumageul deureumyeonseo sukjereul haeyo*  — I do my homework while listening to music.

Additional example:

• 걷면서 생각해요.
  
  *Geot-myeonseo saenggakhaeyo*  — I walk while thinking.

These conjunctions help link ideas and actions smoothly in Korean sentences. Practice forming your own sentences using these patterns.
