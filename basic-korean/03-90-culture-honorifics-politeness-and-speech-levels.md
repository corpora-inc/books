## Honorifics, Politeness, and Speech Levels

Korean language reflects the deep cultural emphasis on respect and social hierarchy. Honorifics and different speech levels are embedded in everyday communication, affecting verb endings and vocabulary. These speech styles signal the speaker’s attitude towards the listener, showing respect based on age, status, or familiarity.

Several key terms are associated with Korean speech levels:

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization | English              |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 존댓말           | jondaetmal   | honorific speech     |
| 반말             | banmal       | informal speech      |
| 높임말           | nopimmal     | respectful language  |
| 해요체           | haeyo-che    | polite form          |

In everyday practice, formal settings such as academic or professional environments typically require 존댓말. In contrast, close friends or younger individuals might use 반말 as a sign of intimacy or casualness. The polite form, 해요체, is commonly used in public settings or when addressing someone whose social rank is uncertain.

Examples in conversation illustrate these distinctions:

| Speaker | Korean (Hangul)      | Romanization             | English Translation            |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Student | 안녕하세요?           | annyeonghaseyo?          | Hello?                         |
| Teacher | 안녕하십니까?         | annyeonghasimnikka?      | Hello? (very formal)           |
| Friend  | 안녕?                | annyeong?                | Hi!                            |

The use of honorifics goes beyond simple politeness; it is a cultural reflection of the respect that underpins Korean social interactions. This language feature is deeply rooted in historical and social traditions, making an understanding of honorifics essential for effective communication in Korean society.
