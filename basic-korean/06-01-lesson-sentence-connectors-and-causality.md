## Sentence Connectors and Causality

This lesson presents common sentence connectors that express cause and effect in Korean. Use these connectors to join clauses and clarify reasons and results.

### Key Connectors

| Korean (Hangul) | Romanization   | English       |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 그래서           | geuraeseo      | so, therefore |
| 때문에           | ttaemune       | because of    |
| 그러므로         | geureomuro     | thus          |
| 그러니까         | geureonikka    | so, therefore |

### Connector Usage

Use sentence connectors to link a cause (reason) with an effect (result). The connector typically follows the clause stating the reason. Observe the examples below.

#### Example 1: Using 그래서

- 날씨가 추워서 집에 있어요.
  *nalssiga chuwoseo jibe isseoyo* — Because the weather is cold, I am staying at home.

#### Example 2: Using 그래서 (another structure)

- 시간이 없어서 빨리 가야 해요.
  *sigani eopseoseo ppalli gaya haeyo* — Because I have no time, I must go quickly.

#### Example 3: Using 때문에

- 버스가 지연 때문에 늦었어요.
  *beoseuga jiyŏn ttaemune neujeossoyo* — I was late because the bus was delayed.

#### Example 4: Using 그러므로

- 공부를 열심히 했으므로 시험에 합격했어요.
  *gongbureul yeolsimhi haesseumuro siheom-e hapgyeokhaesseoyo* — I passed the exam because I studied hard; thus, my effort paid off.

#### Example 5: Using 그러니까

- 피곤하니까 일찍 자야 해요.
  *pigonhanikka iljjik jaya haeyo* — I need to sleep early because I’m tired.

### Practice

Combine the following ideas using an appropriate connector:

1. It rained a lot. Therefore, the picnic was canceled.
   *Hint: Use 그래서 or 그러니까.*

2. I missed the bus. Because of that, I was late for work.
   *Hint: Use 때문에.*

Practice forming sentences by identifying the reason and result, then choosing the correct connector.
