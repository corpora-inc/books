## Contrasts and Emphasis

This lesson presents structures to show differences between subjects or ideas and to add emphasis in Korean sentences.

### 1. Using Contrast Markers

Korean often uses topic markers (은/는) and contrastive connectors (지만) to highlight differences.

• Example 1:

- Hangul: 저는 학생이에요. 친구는 선생님이에요.
- Romanization: jeoneun haksaeng-ieyo. chinguneun seonsaengnim-ieyo.
- English: I am a student. As for my friend, (s)he is a teacher.

• Example 2:

- Hangul: 이 집은 작지만, 정원은 넓어요.
- Romanization: i jip-eun jagjiman, jeongwon-eun neolbeoyo.
- English: This house is small, but the garden is spacious.

### 2. Emphasis Markers

Emphasis can be added using adverbs to intensify an adjective or verb.

• Example 1:

- Hangul: 이 음식은 정말 맛있어요.
- Romanization: i eumsik-eun jeongmal masisseoyo.
- English: This food is really delicious.

• Example 2:

- Hangul: 그것은 단지 시작일 뿐이에요.
- Romanization: geugeos-eun danji sijag-il bpun-ieyo.
- English: That is only the beginning.

Practice combining contrast and emphasis in your own sentences.

Review the sentences and notice how markers such as 은/는, -지만, 정말, and 단지 are used to indicate differences or to intensify meaning.
