# **Markdown Generation Instructions**

Every file in this corpus follows a strict format determined by its filename. The AI must generate content that matches the structure and purpose of each file.

## **Unit and Chapter Introductions**

Unit introductions (`XX-00-00-unit-intro-title.md`) begin with `# Unit Title`. These provide a broad overview of the period or theme, outlining major events, civilizations, and historical trends. They should be long, detailed, and structured as full paragraphs without subheaders. A brief timeline or list of key topics may be included where useful.

Chapter introductions (`XX-YY-00-chapter-intro-title.md`) begin with `## Chapter Title`. These introduce the chapterâ€™s specific focus, summarizing what will be covered. They should be substantial but do not use subheaders.

Each unit and chapter introduction should begin with a block quote relevant to the time period or theme. Quotes from historical figures, scholars, or primary sources are preferred. These should set the tone and encourage reflection without forcing interpretation.

## **Sections**

Sections (`XX-YY-ZZ-section-title.md`) begin with `### Section Title` and should be thorough and well-structured. Subheaders (`####`, `#####`, etc.) should be used as needed to break down complex topics.

Each section must be detailed, prioritizing **facts, dates, names, and primary sources** over generalizations. If a topic is debated, different perspectives should be included. Avoid stating anything as fact unless it is supported by strong evidence. If something is uncertain, say so.

## **Writing Style**

Text should be structured into full paragraphs. Sentences should be short and clear. Bullet points should be used sparingly, only when they improve clarity. The same applies to bold and italic formatting. The goal is to present information in a way that reads like a book, not a webpage.

There should be no filler. No padding. No empty conclusions. The content should be packed with historical detail. Each section should contain as much real information as possible, allowing the reader to form their own understanding from the facts.

You are currently writing a piece of a comprehensive history book. Go as deep as you can into the particular subject at hand. The portion you are writing is part of a larger whole so you do not need to summarize what came before or what comes after or have an elaborate introduction or conclusion. Dive deep directly into the topic and provide as much detail as possible.
