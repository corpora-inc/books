## Changing Line 1

### 周易 Zhou Yi

\begin{center}
初六：濡其尾，吝。
\end{center}

> At the first line (chu liu), the tail is wetted, bringing distress.

This line from Hexagram 64 (Before Completion) indicates a premature or overly hasty movement. By entering the water too soon, the fox (or traveler) ends up wetting its tail, signifying an error that leads to regret or discomfort. The Zhou Yi core text warns that even at the beginning, vigilance is crucial.

### Ten Wings

\begin{center}
《十翼》曰：初涉未穩，濡尾示其輕進；宜審時度勢，方免後悔。
\end{center}

> **The Ten Wings state:** At the first step, when one's footing is not secure, wetting the tail illustrates rash advance. One should carefully assess the situation in order to avoid future remorse

In the Ten Wings commentary, the emphasis is on "lightness of step"—the line cautions that moving too quickly, without firm footing, can sabotage the broader process of crossing. The text urges calm deliberation rather than impulsive action.


### Wang Bi

\begin{center}
王弼曰：初六濡尾，示其心未定而先行，易陷險境，宜戒之。
\end{center}

> **Wang Bi remarks:** The wet tail at the first line shows that the mind is not yet settled, and one acts prematurely, risking peril. Caution is advised.

Wang Bi's reading highlights the psychological aspect of the line: an unsettled mindset drives hasty action, which leads to difficulties. His commentary underscores the need for mental clarity and composure before taking steps toward completion.

### Later Editorial Traditions

\begin{center}
宋人云：初爻之濡尾，蓋小失而生隱患，若能以誠敬自省，則可轉危為安。
\end{center}

> **A Song-era note:** The wet tail at the first line is a small misstep that can breed hidden dangers. Yet if one reflects sincerely and reverently, the threat can be turned into safety.

Later commentaries from the Song dynasty and beyond view the wet tail as a minor but revealing mistake. They stress the importance of sincere self-examination at the earliest stage, so that small errors do not grow into larger crises. This process of reflection can avert potential harm and realign the journey toward eventual success.
