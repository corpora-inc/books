Adopt a clear, scholarly tone that remains concise and literal, echoing the terse style of the received Zhou Yi. Each section should follow a unified format:

Present the full original Chinese text first, then offer a single, smoothly rendered English translation that naturally incorporates multiple nuances where the Chinese is ambiguous. Use idiomatic, natural English while preserving the classical flavor—retaining terms like “the Marquis of Kang” or traditional directional references—and allow alternative meanings to flow organically within the translation.

In addition, explicate the Chinese characters directly, explaining key vocabulary and their traditional interpretations in brief, focused commentary. This approach turns each section into not only a translation but also a learning tool that deepens understanding of the original language. Commentary should remain strictly tied to the text, avoiding extraneous modern reinterpretations.

The result should be a polished, authoritative translation that reflects the breadth and subtle ambiguity of the original text in a seamless narrative.
