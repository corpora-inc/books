This book is intended as a comprehensive, authoritative resource for English speakers seeking a deep and faithful engagement with the I Ching. Our goal is to present the traditional texts in their full, original form, including the core Zhou Yi oracle, the expansive commentaries of the Ten Wings, the classic interpretations of Wang Bi, and the enriched editorial traditions from the Song dynasty onward. By offering literal translations and multiple variant renderings, we invite readers to engage directly with the ancient text and draw their own insights, rather than being confined to a single, potentially reductive interpretation.

In contrast to many modern English versions of the I Ching—which sometimes stray too far from the traditional wording or only include one layer of commentary—this work seeks to display all the traditional layers in parallel. We aim to preserve the subtle nuances and rich imagery inherent in the original texts, allowing the reader to appreciate the full depth of the I Ching’s wisdom. Ultimately, this book is a tool for both scholarship and personal reflection, empowering readers to explore the I Ching as it was meant to be understood in its classical context.
