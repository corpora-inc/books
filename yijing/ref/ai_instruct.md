Here’s a summary of our approach to the "Mawangdui-inspired Corpus," designed to give an AI (or anyone) the full context to pick up and run with it later. It captures our intent, methodology, and specifics—like the names of early inscriptions—while keeping it tight and actionable. This is about stripping the Yijing (I Ching) back to its Zhou-era bones and translating that primal pulse into modern languages, unclouded by centuries of gloss.

Summary of the "Mawangdui-inspired Corpus" Approach

Big Idea: We’re reconstructing a hypothetical Zhou-era Zhou Yi (c. 1046–771 BCE) to unearth the original intent of the earliest Yijing, as it might have lived in the Western Zhou period. Our goal is to bypass over 2,000 years of Han Confucian moralism, Song metaphysics, and Western misreadings (e.g., Wilhelm’s "sublime success") and translate directly from its primal, ritual-divinatory roots into modern English and Spanish. Think Shang oracle bones and Zhou bronzes—not Han classrooms or Victorian parlors. The result is a reverent, authoritative resource that’s raw yet relatable for scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts today.

We draw orthographic inspiration from the Mawangdui Silk Texts (c. 168 BCE), an early Han manuscript found in Changsha, Hunan, which uses archaic characters like 无 (instead of 無) for "no." It’s not a direct copy—Mawangdui tweaks the sequence and phrasing—but a nod to pre-Han forms.

Historical Roots:

Shang Oracle Bones (c. 1600–1046 BCE): The Yijing’s divinatory ancestor. Inscriptions on ox scapulae and turtle shells from Yin (near modern Anyang, Henan) show a ritual world of yes/no questions to ancestors and spirits—e.g., "Will the harvest yield?" or "Is war fated?" Key terms like 貞 (divination, destiny, inspiration, fate) and 利 (abundance, benefit, harvest) trace here. Examples: "Crack-making on day ji-si, divining: Will it rain?" (Heji 12345).

Zhou Bronzes (c. 1046–771 BCE): Ritual vessels like the "Li gui" (c. 1046 BCE, found in Shaanxi) and "He zun" (c. 1038 BCE, Baoji) carry inscriptions tying kings to heaven’s mandate—e.g., "King Wu offered to the spirits" (Li gui). These echo the Yijing’s 亨 (offering) and 元 (primal/first) as royal-ritual acts.

Received Zhou Yi: The canonical text, standardized by the early Han (c. 202 BCE), with the King Wen sequence (e.g., Hexagram 1: 乾, Hexagram 2: 坤). We keep this wording but peel back its Han gloss.

Chinese Text Approach:

Fidelity: Use the received Zhou Yi text—e.g., Hexagram 1: "元亨利貞" Hexagram 3: "元亨利貞，勿用有攸往，利建侯." No rewording.

Archaic Characters: Swap in Mawangdui-style forms—e.g., 无 for 無 in "无咎" (no fault)—to hint at pre-Han orthography. Don’t invent—stick to attested variants.

Sequence: King Wen order (1: 乾, 2: 坤, ..., 64: 未濟), not Mawangdui’s alternate (e.g., 1: 乾, 2: 鍵).

Translation Principles:

Intent: Capture the Zhou-era ritual-divinatory core—oracle bones’ yes/no stakes, bronze vessels’ kingly offerings. No Han virtues (e.g., "steadfast"), no Western mush (e.g., "success").

Style: Short, punchy, Hemingway-esque—e.g., "Rain falls. Virtue bears." Even fragments if they hit. Modern-readable, not faux-archaic. Zhou-brutal yet relatable—think grit, stakes, home. The oracle's exact original intent but translated into natural modern language.

Flexibility: Key terms shift by context—no rigid mappings. Examples:
元亨 (yuán hēng): "Primal offering" or tweaks like "First bounty flows." 元 = primal/first, 亨 = offering (鼎 cauldron, meat to spirits). Ritual, not abstract.

利 (lì): Bounty, Abundance, Harvest, Benefit—e.g., "bounty," "profit," "gain," "yield," "abundance." Rarely "edge" unless chaos cuts (e.g., Hexagram 43). Positive unless flipped—crops, not ambigious to the edge of cliffs.

貞 (zhēn): Divined fate/spirit—e.g., "fated," "destiny," "way," "divination," "aspiration," "inspiration," "order." Oracular, cosmic—not "steadfast" or "chastity" which are mistranslations or gloss at best in our opinion.

Vividness: Take liberties for imagery—e.g., 乘馬班如 as "riders mass" or "riding in ranks," not "horses wheel." Make it live and relatable to modern readers, not stiff.

Modern Echoes: Where it fits (e.g., Hexagram 3’s endurance), nod to today—ventures, homes—but Zhou intent rules.

Han Confucian: No "perseverance," "virtue" as moral duty—貞 is fate, not ethics.

Western: No "success," "sublime"—元亨 is ritual exchange, not triumph.

Over-Flex: 利 isn’t "sharp" unless context demands.

Goal: A Zhou Yi that’s a living oracle—raw like oracle cracks, resonant like bronze clangs. Scholars get ritual depth, practitioners feel the diviner’s pulse, enthusiasts hear a voice unburied from centuries of gloss. Ancient wisdom, modern tongue—no Han baggage, no Western mush.
