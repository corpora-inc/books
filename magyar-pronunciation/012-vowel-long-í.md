# Long Vowel 'í'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian long vowel 'í' is pronounced similarly to the 'ee' in the English word "see", but it is longer in duration. In English, vowel length can vary depending on the context, but in Hungarian, the length of 'í' is consistent and distinctly long. To produce this sound, start with your tongue high and front in your mouth, lips spread, and maintain the sound for a longer duration than you would for a typical English 'ee'. The IPA symbol for this sound is /iː/.
