# Short Vowel 'e'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian short vowel 'e' is represented in IPA as /ɛ/. For English speakers, this sound is similar to the 'e' in "bet" or "let". It is a front, open-mid vowel, meaning your tongue is positioned forward and somewhat low in your mouth. Unlike the English 'e' which can sometimes be pronounced as /eɪ/ (as in "late"), the Hungarian /ɛ/ is consistently short and does not glide into another vowel sound.
