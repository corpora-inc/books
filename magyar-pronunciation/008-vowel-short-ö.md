# Short Vowel 'ö'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian short vowel 'ö' is represented in IPA as /ø/. For English speakers, the closest sound to /ø/ is the 'u' in the word "turn" or the 'e' in "herd" as pronounced in some British accents, though 'ö' is more rounded and pronounced with the lips pushed forward. It's important to keep the vowel short and crisp, unlike the longer vowel sounds in English. To practice, start by saying "turn" and try to round your lips more while keeping the sound short.
