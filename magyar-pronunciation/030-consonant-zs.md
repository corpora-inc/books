# Consonant 'zs'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'zs' represents a voiced postalveolar fricative, similar to the 's' sound in English "measure" or "treasure". This sound is produced by directing air flow along the central line of the tongue, which is positioned close to the palate behind the alveolar ridge. The vocal cords vibrate during its production, classifying it as a voiced fricative. For English speakers, the 'zs' sound is akin to the 'zh' in "vision" or "decision".
