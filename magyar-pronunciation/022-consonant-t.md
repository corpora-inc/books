# Consonant 't'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 't' is a voiceless alveolar stop, similar to the English 't' as in "top" /tɒp/. In Hungarian, this sound is always pronounced clearly and distinctly, without the aspiration that often accompanies the English 't' at the beginning of words. It is produced by stopping the airflow with the tongue against the alveolar ridge and then releasing it abruptly.
