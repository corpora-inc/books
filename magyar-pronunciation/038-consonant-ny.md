# Consonant 'ny'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'ny' is represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet as /ɲ/. This sound falls into the category of nasals, similar to English 'n' and 'm'. For English speakers, the closest approximation to /ɲ/ is the 'ni' sound in "canyon" or the 'ny' in the Spanish word "señor". To produce /ɲ/, start by making the 'n' sound, but position your tongue against the roof of your mouth, just behind your front teeth, and allow the air to escape through your nose. It is a single, distinct sound in Hungarian, not a combination of 'n' and 'y'.
