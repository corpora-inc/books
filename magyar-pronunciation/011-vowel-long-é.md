# Long Vowel 'é'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian long vowel 'é' is pronounced as /eː/. For English speakers, this sound is similar to the 'a' in "day" (/deɪ/), but without the glide at the end. It is crucial to maintain the length of this vowel, as it distinguishes it from the short 'e' sound in Hungarian. In English, you might find a similar long, pure vowel sound in some accents in words like "they" (/ðeɪ/) when pronounced more like /ðeː/. Keep your tongue high and front in your mouth, and stretch the vowel sound longer than you would in English.
