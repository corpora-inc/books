# Vowel Harmony

Vowel harmony in Hungarian is a phonological rule that affects how vowels within a word or between a stem and its suffixes must agree in terms of their frontness or backness. This rule ensures that the vowels in a word are either all front or all back, creating a harmonious sound pattern.

## Front vs. Back Vowels

In Hungarian, vowels are categorized as either front or back. Front vowels are articulated with the tongue positioned towards the front of the mouth, similar to the English 'ee' in 'see'. Back vowels, on the other hand, are produced with the tongue positioned further back, akin to the English 'oo' in 'moon'. The distinction plays a crucial role in vowel harmony, determining which vowels can coexist within a word.

Front vowels in Hungarian include /i/, /í/, /e/, /é/, and /ö/, /ő/, /ü/, /ű/. Back vowels include /a/, /á/, /o/, /ó/, /u/, /ú/. The presence of a front vowel in a stem will require any suffixes added to it to also contain front vowels, and vice versa for back vowels.

## Suffix Adjustment

Suffixes in Hungarian must adapt to the vowel harmony of the stem they attach to. If a stem contains front vowels, any suffix added to it will also use front vowels. Conversely, if the stem contains back vowels, the suffix will use back vowels. This adjustment ensures the maintenance of vowel harmony across the entire word.

For example, the suffix for the plural in Hungarian is '-k', but the vowel preceding it changes based on the stem's vowels: '-ok' for back vowel stems, and '-ek' for front vowel stems. This rule applies consistently across all suffixes that have vowel alternates.
