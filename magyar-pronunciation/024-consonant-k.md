# Consonant 'k'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian 'k' is a voiceless velar stop, similar to the 'k' sound in English words like "kite" or "cool". In Hungarian, this sound is always pronounced at the back of the throat, with the tongue making contact with the soft palate. Unlike in English, where 'k' can sometimes be softened or aspirated (as in "kin" vs. "can"), the Hungarian 'k' is consistently hard and unaspirated, meaning there's no puff of air following the sound. This makes it more akin to the 'k' in "ski" in English.
