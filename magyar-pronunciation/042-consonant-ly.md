# Consonant 'ly'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'ly' is pronounced as /j/, which is a glide. For English speakers, this sound is very familiar; it's the same sound as the 'y' in "yes" or the 'j' in "job". It's produced by directing air over the front part of the tongue without causing any friction, similar to how you would start the word "you".

- *lyuk* - /juk/ - hole

- *hely* - /hɛj/ - place
- *folyó* - /fojoː/ - river
