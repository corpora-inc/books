# Stress Rules

## First Syllable Stress

In Hungarian, stress is consistently placed on the first syllable of a word. This rule is almost exceptionless, making Hungarian stress patterns highly predictable. Unlike English, where stress can fall on any syllable and often changes the meaning of words, Hungarian stress does not affect word meaning. For English speakers, this might feel unusual because English often stresses the root or a significant syllable, which can be anywhere in the word.

For example, while an English word like "photograph" (/ˈfoʊ.tə.ɡræf/) stresses the first syllable, "photography" (/fəˈtɑː.ɡrə.fi/) stresses the second, and "photographic" (/ˌfoʊ.təˈɡræf.ɪk/) the third. In contrast, Hungarian would stress the first syllable in all equivalent forms.
