# Consonant 'n'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'n' is a nasal consonant, similar to the English 'n' as in "no" or "new". It is articulated by allowing air to escape through the nose while the tongue tip touches the alveolar ridge, just behind the upper front teeth. In Hungarian, the 'n' sound remains consistent across different positions in a word, unlike in English where it might change slightly depending on the surrounding sounds.
