# Consonant 'sz'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'sz' is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar fricative, represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as /s/. For English speakers, this sound is very similar to the 's' sound in words like "see" or "bus". It is produced by directing air through a narrow channel between the tongue and the alveolar ridge (just behind the upper front teeth), creating a hissing sound. Unlike some English 's' sounds which can be voiced (like in "is"), 'sz' in Hungarian is always voiceless.
