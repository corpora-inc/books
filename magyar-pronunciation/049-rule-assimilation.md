# Assimilation

Assimilation in Hungarian involves one sound changing to become more like a neighboring sound. This process is common in spoken language and can affect both consonants and vowels, though we'll focus on consonants here.

## Voicing Rules

In Hungarian, consonant assimilation often involves voicing. Voicing assimilation occurs when a voiceless consonant becomes voiced or vice versa, influenced by the voicing of an adjacent consonant. This typically happens across word boundaries or within compound words.

For English speakers, think of how "cats" /kæts/ becomes "dogs" /dɔɡz/; the /s/ in "cats" is voiceless, while the /z/ in "dogs" is voiced. In Hungarian, this assimilation is more systematic:

- When a voiceless consonant precedes a voiced consonant, it may become voiced. For example, /t/ before /b/ might become /d/.
- Conversely, a voiced consonant may become voiceless before a voiceless consonant. For example, /d/ before /p/ might become /t/.

This rule applies particularly to the stops and fricatives, affecting sounds like /p, t, k, b, d, g/ and /f, s, ʃ, v, z, ʒ/.

## Examples

- *házba* - /haːzba/ - into the house (voicing: /z/ remains voiced before /b/)
- *hatvan* - /hɒtvɒn/ - sixty (voicing: /t/ becomes voiceless before /v/)
- *szép* *kert* - /seːp kɛrt/ - beautiful garden (voicing: /p/ remains voiceless before /k/)
- *dob* *pont* - /dob pont/ - drum point (voicing: /b/ becomes voiceless before /p/)
