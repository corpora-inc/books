# Short Vowel 'a'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian short vowel 'a' is represented in IPA as /ɒ/. For English speakers, this sound is similar to the 'o' in the American English pronunciation of "hot" or "dog," but it's more open and rounded. Unlike the English vowel, which can shift slightly in different accents, the Hungarian /ɒ/ is consistently pronounced in the same way, with the tongue low and the lips rounded. When pronouncing this sound, try to keep your jaw relaxed and your lips in a rounded position, similar to blowing out a candle, but without pushing the air out forcefully.
