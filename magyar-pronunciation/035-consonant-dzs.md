# Consonant 'dzs'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'dzs' is an affricate, which means it starts as a stop and releases into a fricative. For English speakers, 'dzs' can be thought of as the sound in the middle of "hedge" (/hɛdʒ/) but voiced, similar to the 'j' in "jam" (/dʒæm/) but with a more pronounced 'd' at the start. In IPA, 'dzs' is represented as /dʒ/. To articulate it, start with your tongue against the alveolar ridge (like the 'd' in "dog"), then release it into the 'zh' sound (like the 's' in "measure").
