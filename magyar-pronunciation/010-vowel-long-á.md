# Long Vowel 'á'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian long vowel 'á' is pronounced as /aː/. For English speakers, this sound is similar to the 'a' in "father" but significantly longer. In English, vowel length is not phonemic, meaning it doesn't change the meaning of words, but in Hungarian, the length of vowels like 'á' is crucial. When pronouncing 'á', make sure to hold the sound for about twice as long as you would for a short 'a'. The vowel should be open and relaxed, positioned at the back of the mouth.
