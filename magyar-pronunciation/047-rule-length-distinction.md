# Phonemic Length

In Hungarian, phonemic length plays a crucial role in distinguishing meaning. This feature affects both vowels and consonants, where the duration of the sound can change the word's meaning entirely. For English speakers, understanding this aspect can be challenging as English does not use length contrastively to the same extent.

## Vowels and Consonants

### Vowels

Hungarian vowels can be either short or long, and this distinction is phonemic. Long vowels are approximately twice as long as their short counterparts. The English vowel in "see" (/iː/) can serve as a reference for a long vowel, while the vowel in "sit" (/ɪ/) is akin to a short vowel. However, in Hungarian, these lengths are more consistently applied across all vowels.

- Short vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/, /ö/, /ü/
- Long vowels: /aː/, /eː/, /iː/, /oː/, /uː/, /øː/, /yː/

### Consonants

Similarly, certain consonants in Hungarian can also exhibit a length distinction. This primarily affects stops and fricatives. For example, the difference between a short /p/ and a long /pː/ is akin to the difference between the 'p' in "spin" and a prolonged version of that sound, although English does not use this for meaning differentiation.

- Short consonants: /p/, /t/, /k/, /b/, /d/, /g/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /f/, /v/
- Long consonants: /pː/, /tː/, /kː/, /bː/, /dː/, /gː/, /sː/, /zː/, /ʃː/, /ʒː/, /fː/, /vː/
