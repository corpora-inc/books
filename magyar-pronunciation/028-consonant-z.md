# Consonant 'z'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'z' is a voiced alveolar fricative, represented in IPA as /z/. For English speakers, this sound is quite familiar as it is identical to the 'z' sound in English words like "zoo" or "zebra." It's produced by directing air through a narrow channel between the tongue and the alveolar ridge, causing friction. The vocal cords vibrate during its articulation, which is why it's classified as a voiced fricative.
