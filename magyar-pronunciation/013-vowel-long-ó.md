# Long Vowel 'ó'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian long vowel 'ó' is pronounced as /oː/. For English speakers, the closest approximation to this sound is the 'o' in "core" but held longer. The key difference is the length: in Hungarian, 'ó' is significantly longer than any vowel typically found in English words. Imagine saying the 'o' in "core" but extending it to about twice its normal duration. The sound should be pure and steady, without the diphthong glide that often accompanies English long vowels.
