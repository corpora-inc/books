# Short Vowel 'u'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian short vowel 'u', represented as /u/ in IPA, is a high back rounded vowel. For English speakers, it is similar to the 'oo' sound in "book" or "look," but it is slightly more rounded and tense. Unlike in English, where the 'oo' sound can sometimes be pronounced more centrally or with less rounding, the Hungarian /u/ maintains a consistent back and rounded position in the mouth. When pronouncing it, try to keep your lips fully rounded and the sound high in your mouth.
