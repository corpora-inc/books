# Long Vowel 'ű'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian long vowel 'ű' is represented in IPA as /yː/. This sound is a close front rounded vowel, which can be challenging for English speakers because English lacks this exact sound. To approximate 'ű', start by saying the English word "see" (/siː/), but round your lips as if you are saying "oo" in "food" (/fuːd/). The result should be a high-pitched, rounded sound. Importantly, 'ű' is a long vowel, so hold the sound longer than you would a typical English vowel. Think of it as saying the rounded "see" sound for about twice the duration of a short vowel in English.

## Examples
- *űr* - /yːr/ - space
- *űző* - /yːzøː/ - chaser
- *űrlap* - /yːrlap/ - form
