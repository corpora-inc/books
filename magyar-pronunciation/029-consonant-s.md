# Consonant 's'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 's' is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar fricative, similar to the 's' sound in English words like "see" or "bus". It is represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as /s/. This sound is produced by directing air through a narrow channel between the tongue and the alveolar ridge, creating a hissing sound. Unlike in English, where 's' can be voiced in certain positions (e.g., in "dogs" as /z/), the Hungarian 's' remains voiceless in all contexts.
