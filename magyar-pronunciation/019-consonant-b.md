# Consonant 'b'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'b' is pronounced similarly to the English 'b'. It is a voiced bilabial stop, meaning you use both lips to block the airflow and then release it, and your vocal cords vibrate during its production. In English, you can find this sound at the beginning of words like "boy" or "bat". In Hungarian, 'b' maintains its sound in all positions within a word, unlike English where 'b' can be silent or pronounced differently (e.g., "debt", "subtle").
