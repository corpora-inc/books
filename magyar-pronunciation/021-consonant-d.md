# Consonant 'd'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'd' is a voiced alveolar stop, similar to the English 'd' in "dog" (/d/). It is produced by stopping the airflow with the tongue against the alveolar ridge and then releasing it. The key difference from English is that Hungarian 'd' is always pronounced the same way, without the variations that occur in English due to surrounding sounds or positions in words.
