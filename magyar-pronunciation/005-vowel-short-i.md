# Short Vowel 'i'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian short vowel 'i' is represented as /i/ in IPA. For English speakers, this sound is similar to the 'ee' in "see" or the 'i' in "machine". However, the Hungarian /i/ is typically shorter and more centralized than its English counterparts. It's important to keep the sound crisp and not to let it drift towards a diphthong as can happen in English.

## Examples

- *itt* - /it/ - here
- *kicsi* - /kit͡ʃi/ - small
- *híd* - /hiːd/ - bridge
- *igaz* - /igɒz/ - true
