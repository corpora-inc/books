# Consonant 'cs'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'cs' represents a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate, similar to the 'ch' in English "church". It is produced by first stopping the airflow with the tongue against the palate, then releasing it to create a fricative sound. This sound is categorized as an affricate, which means it starts as a stop and ends as a fricative. For English speakers, the 'cs' sound is quite familiar, as it is identical to the 'ch' in "cheese" or "chocolate".
