# Short Vowel 'o'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian short vowel 'o' is represented as /o/ in IPA. For English speakers, the sound is similar to the 'o' in "off" or "hot," but it's more rounded and pronounced with the lips more protruded. Unlike the English 'o', which often shifts towards an 'ah' sound, the Hungarian /o/ remains a pure, steady vowel sound. It is important to keep the tongue position relatively high and the vowel short and crisp.
