# How to Use This Book

This book is designed to help English speakers master Hungarian pronunciation. Each section focuses on a specific aspect of Hungarian phonology, providing detailed explanations, comparisons to English sounds, and practical examples. Progress through the sections in order to build a comprehensive understanding of Hungarian pronunciation.

## Reading IPA Notation

Throughout this book, we use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to accurately represent Hungarian sounds. IPA symbols help you understand the exact pronunciation of each word. Here's how to interpret them:

- **Vowels**: Hungarian vowels are represented by symbols like /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/, which are similar to their English counterparts but often more consistent in pronunciation.
- **Consonants**: Symbols like /p/, /t/, /k/ represent sounds familiar to English speakers, while others like /ʃ/ (as in "ship") or /ʒ/ (as in "measure") may require more attention.
- **Diacritics**: Marks like [ˈ] indicate primary stress, and [ː] shows a long vowel or consonant.

Familiarize yourself with these symbols to better understand the pronunciation guides provided.

## Understanding Examples

Each section includes examples formatted as follows:

- *Hungarian word* - /IPA/ - meaning

For instance:

- *kutya* - /ˈkucːɒ/ - dog

This format helps you see the Hungarian spelling, hear the pronunciation through IPA, and understand the word's meaning, facilitating a deeper connection between sound and meaning.
