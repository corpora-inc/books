# Short Vowel 'ü'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian short vowel 'ü' is represented in IPA as /y/. For English speakers, this sound can be challenging because it does not directly correspond to any vowel sound in standard American or British English. The closest approximation might be the sound in the German word "üben" or the French "tu". 

To produce /y/, start by saying the English 'ee' sound as in "see" (/i/). Keep your tongue in this position, but round your lips as if you were going to whistle or say the English 'oo' sound as in "food" (/u/). The resulting sound should be a high, front, rounded vowel, which is the Hungarian 'ü'.

## Examples

- *süt* - /syt/ - to bake
- *függ* - /fygː/ - to hang
- *külön* - /kyløn/ - separate
- *üt* - /yt/ - to hit
