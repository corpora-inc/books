# Consonant 'dz'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'dz' is an affricate, which means it starts as a stop and releases into a fricative. For English speakers, it's similar to the 'ds' sound in "odds" or "buds," but voiced. In 'dz', the tongue tip touches the alveolar ridge, blocking the airflow completely, and then releases it into a 'z' sound. The key is to ensure both the stop and the fricative are voiced, unlike the English 'ts' sound in "cats," which is unvoiced.
