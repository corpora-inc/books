# Digraphs

## Consistent Sounds

In Hungarian, digraphs are combinations of two letters that represent a single sound. Understanding these is crucial for accurate pronunciation. Here's how to pronounce the common Hungarian digraphs:

- **cs**: Pronounced as /tʃ/, similar to the 'ch' in English "church". It's a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate.
- **dz**: This is /dz/, like the 'ds' in "adds". It's a voiced alveolar affricate.
- **dzs**: Pronounced /dʒ/, akin to the 'j' in "jam". It's a voiced palato-alveolar affricate.
- **gy**: This sound is /ɟ/, which does not exist in English. It's similar to the 'd' in "dude" but with the tongue positioned further back, close to the palate.
- **ly**: Pronounced /j/, like the 'y' in "yes". It's a palatal approximant.
- **ny**: This is /ɲ/, similar to the 'ny' in Spanish "señor". It's a palatal nasal, where the tongue touches the hard palate.
- **sz**: Pronounced /s/, like the 's' in "see". It's a voiceless alveolar fricative.
- **ty**: This sound is /c/, which does not exist in English. It's similar to the 't' in "tea" but with the tongue positioned further back, close to the palate.
- **zs**: Pronounced /ʒ/, like the 's' in "measure". It's a voiced postalveolar fricative.
