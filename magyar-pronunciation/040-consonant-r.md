# Consonant 'r'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'r' is a voiced alveolar trill, categorized as a liquid consonant. For English speakers, this sound can be compared to the 'r' in Spanish words like "pero" or the rolled 'r' some English speakers use in words like "red" when emphasizing the sound. Unlike the typical English 'r', which is often an approximant, the Hungarian 'r' involves the tip of the tongue vibrating against the alveolar ridge. To produce this sound, try to make your tongue tip flutter rapidly against the ridge just behind your upper front teeth.
