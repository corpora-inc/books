# Consonant 'l'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'l' is represented in IPA as /l/. It is categorized as a liquid, similar to its English counterpart. For English speakers, the Hungarian /l/ sounds very much like the 'l' in "light" or "love". It is an alveolar lateral approximant, meaning the tip of the tongue touches the alveolar ridge, and air flows around the sides of the tongue. The key difference from English is that Hungarian 'l' is always clear, even when it comes after a vowel, whereas in English, 'l' can become dark (velarized) in positions like the end of "ball".
