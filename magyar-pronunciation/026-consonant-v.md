# Consonant 'v'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'v' is a voiced labiodental fricative, represented in IPA as /v/. For English speakers, this sound is very familiar, as it is identical to the 'v' sound in English words like "very" or "love." It is produced by placing the upper teeth on the lower lip and allowing air to flow through, creating a fricative sound.
