# Consonant 'h'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'h' is a voiceless glottal fricative, represented in IPA as /h/. For English speakers, this sound is quite familiar as it is similar to the 'h' sound at the beginning of words like "hat" or "house." In Hungarian, 'h' is always pronounced as this sound, without variation, and it is categorized as a fricative, meaning it's produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, in this case, the glottis.
