# Consonant 'ty'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'ty' is a digraph, meaning it is represented by two letters but functions as a single sound. It is pronounced as a palatal stop, similar to the 't' sound in English but articulated with the tongue against the hard palate, closer to where you would say 'y' in 'yes'. For English speakers, it can be approximated by trying to say 't' while the tongue is in the position to say 'y'. The IPA transcription for 'ty' is /c/.
