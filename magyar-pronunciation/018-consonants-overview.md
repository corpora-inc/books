# Hungarian Consonants

Hungarian consonants can be quite different from those in English, but understanding their categories and specific sounds can help you master Hungarian pronunciation. Hungarian has a rich set of consonants that can be categorized into several groups, each with unique characteristics.

## Categories

Hungarian consonants are divided into the following categories:

- **Stops**: These are sounds produced by completely blocking the airflow in the mouth and then releasing it. Hungarian has both voiced and voiceless stops. Voiced stops are similar to English 'b', 'd', 'g', while voiceless stops are like 'p', 't', 'k'. For example, /b/ as in *baba* (doll) and /p/ as in *papa* (father).

- **Fricatives**: These sounds are produced by forcing air through a narrow channel, causing friction. Hungarian fricatives include sounds like /s/ and /ʃ/, which are similar to English 's' in *see* and 'sh' in *shoe*. For example, /s/ as in *szép* (beautiful) and /ʃ/ as in *sajt* (cheese).

- **Affricates**: These are a combination of a stop followed immediately by a fricative. Hungarian has affricates like /ts/ and /tʃ/, which can be compared to English 'ts' in *cats* and 'ch' in *church*. For example, /ts/ as in *cica* (kitty) and /tʃ/ as in *csiga* (snail).

- **Nasals**: These are sounds produced by lowering the soft palate to allow air to escape through the nose. Hungarian nasals include /m/, /n/, and /ɲ/, which are similar to English 'm', 'n', and 'ny' in *canyon*. For example, /m/ as in *mama* (mom) and /ɲ/ as in *nyúl* (rabbit).

- **Laterals**: These sounds are produced by directing air along the sides of the tongue. Hungarian has the lateral /l/, similar to English 'l' in *love*. For example, /l/ as in *lány* (girl).

- **Approximants**: These are sounds produced by bringing one articulator close to another without creating turbulent airflow. Hungarian approximants include /j/ and /r/, which are similar to English 'y' in *yes* and 'r' in *red*. For example, /j/ as in *jó* (good) and /r/ as in *róka* (fox).

## Digraphs

In Hungarian, digraphs play a crucial role in representing sounds that are not represented by single letters. A digraph is a pair of letters used to write one sound or a combination of sounds that do not correspond to the individual letters' sounds.

- **sz** represents the sound /s/, as in *szép* (beautiful).
- **zs** represents the sound /ʒ/, similar to the 's' in English *measure*, as in *zsír* (fat).
- **cs** represents the sound /tʃ/, as in *csiga* (snail).
- **gy** represents the sound /ɟ/, similar to a soft 'g' in some English dialects, as in *gyümölcs* (fruit).
- **ly** represents the sound /j/, as in *lyuk* (hole).
- **ny** represents the sound /ɲ/, as in *nyúl* (rabbit).
- **ty** represents the sound /c/, similar to the 'ch' in English *church* but softer, as in *tyúk* (hen).

Understanding these digraphs is essential for accurate pronunciation and reading in Hungarian. They are unique to the language and often cause confusion for English speakers due to their unfamiliar combinations and sounds.
