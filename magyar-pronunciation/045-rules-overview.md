# Pronunciation Rules

## Why Rules Matter

Understanding pronunciation rules is crucial for achieving fluency in Hungarian. These rules help you predict how words sound based on their spelling, which is especially important in Hungarian due to its consistent orthography. By mastering these rules, you can speak more naturally and be understood more easily, as your pronunciation will closely match that of native speakers.

## Key Concepts

### Stress

In Hungarian, stress is always on the first syllable of a word. This is a significant difference from English, where stress can vary and often affects meaning. For example, in the word *szótár* (dictionary), the stress falls on *szó*. This consistent stress pattern simplifies pronunciation for learners.

### Length

Hungarian distinguishes between short and long vowels and consonants, which can change the meaning of words. Long vowels are indicated by an acute accent (e.g., *á*, *é*) and are held about twice as long as their short counterparts. For consonants, doubling a letter indicates length (e.g., *tt*, *ss*). For example, *ház* (house) has a long *á*, while *haz* (home) has a short *a*. This is similar to the difference between English *bit* and *beat*.

### Assimilation

Assimilation in Hungarian involves sounds changing to become more similar to neighboring sounds, a process familiar to English speakers in words like *impossible* (where the *n* of *in-* becomes an *m* before *p*). In Hungarian, this often occurs with consonants at word boundaries. For example, *egy* (a, an) before *kutya* (dog) becomes *egy kutya*, but the *g* assimilates to *k*, sounding like *ek kutya*.

## Examples

- *szótár* - /ˈsoːtaːr/ - dictionary
- *ház* - /haːz/ - house
- *haz* - /haz/ - home
- *egy kutya* - /ɛk ˈkucɒ/ - a dog
