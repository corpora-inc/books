# Consonant 'p'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'p' is a voiceless bilabial stop, similar to the 'p' in English words like "pat" or "top." In Hungarian, it is pronounced with a complete closure of the lips, followed by a release that produces a sharp sound. Unlike in English, where 'p' can be aspirated (followed by a puff of air), the Hungarian 'p' is typically unaspirated. This means it sounds somewhat softer compared to the English 'p' at the beginning of words.
