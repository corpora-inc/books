# Consonant 'gy'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian consonant 'gy' is a digraph, meaning it consists of two letters representing a single sound. It is pronounced as a palatal stop, similar to the 'd' sound in English 'duty' but with the tongue positioned further back towards the palate. The sound is voiced, and in IPA, it is represented as /ɟ/. English speakers might find it helpful to start with the 'd' sound and then try to articulate it more towards the middle of the mouth, close to where you would say 'y' in 'yes'.
