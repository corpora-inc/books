# Long Vowel 'ú'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian long vowel 'ú' is pronounced as /uː/. This sound is similar to the 'oo' in English words like "moon" or "food," but it is longer in duration. In Hungarian, vowel length can change the meaning of words, so it's crucial to hold the sound longer than you might in English. Try to prolong the 'oo' sound in "moon" to feel the difference. The lips are rounded and protruded, and the tongue is positioned at the back of the mouth, similar to the English sound but sustained.
