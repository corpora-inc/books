# Consonant 'm'

## Pronunciation
The Hungarian 'm' is a nasal consonant, pronounced similarly to the English 'm' as in "man" /mæn/. It is produced by closing the lips and allowing air to escape through the nose. Like its English counterpart, the Hungarian 'm' can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of words.
