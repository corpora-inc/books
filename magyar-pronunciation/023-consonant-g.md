# Consonant 'g'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian consonant 'g' is a voiced velar stop, similar to the 'g' sound in English words like "go" or "give." In both languages, it is produced by stopping the airflow at the back of the mouth with the back of the tongue against the soft palate, then releasing it. However, in Hungarian, the 'g' sound is always hard, never softening to a sound like the 'j' in "gem" as it might in some English dialects.
