# Consonant 'c'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian consonant 'c' is pronounced as /ts/, which is a voiceless alveolar affricate. For English speakers, this sound is similar to the 'ts' sound found in words like "cats" or "its." It starts with a stop similar to the 't' in "stop," followed immediately by a fricative like the 's' in "see." This sound is a single, quick unit in Hungarian, not a blend of two separate sounds as it might be in English.
