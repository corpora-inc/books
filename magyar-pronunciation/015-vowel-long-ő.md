# Long Vowel 'ő'

## Pronunciation

The Hungarian long vowel 'ő' is represented in IPA as /øː/. It is a front, rounded vowel, similar to the vowel sound in the English word "herd" but with lip rounding. To pronounce 'ő', start with the 'e' sound in "herd" and round your lips as if you were saying "oo" in "food". The key is to maintain the tongue position of 'e' while rounding the lips. Additionally, 'ő' is a long vowel, meaning it is held for a longer duration than its short counterpart 'ö' (/ø/).

For English speakers, practicing 'ő' can be approached by saying "herd" and then rounding the lips without changing the tongue position. Keep in mind that the vowel should be held longer than a typical English vowel.
